   > a. What is an _issue_?
   - Items that can be created in a repository to plan, discuss and track work
   Issues let us track our work on Github. 
    > b. What is a _pull request_?
    A request to tell about new changes that have been pushed to a branch in a repository.An open pull request can be reviewed before merging new changes or rejecting changes to the repo.
    It helps track and review any updates.

    > c. How do I open up a _pull request_?
    Once the changes have been pushed to the remote server, on Github, under pull requests tab, there is an option to create "New pull request". Once selected we can select the base and compare(with new updates) branch to compare the changes and create pull request. We can provide meaningful comments and leave our request open for review.
    
    > d. Give me a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository.
    -->On Github, under settings, choose option Collaborators under access --> under manage access, click on add people 
    -->Once the pop up is displayed, enter the username/email and add user to this repository.

    > e. What is the difference between `git` and `GitHub`?

    Git is an open-source version control system that let's users track their code. It provides a distributed development platform where multiple users can work on different branches of code simultaneously while having full history of their changes and can merge them together when ready.

    GitHub is a web-based hosting server for Git repositories.
    GitHub provides an easy to use  user interface to git.It makes easier to collaborate and share work.

    > f. What does `git diff` do?
    It compares two given paths (indexes,obects or files) and shows us the differences.
    It can even be used to show changes added to the staging area
    > g. What is the `main` branch?
    It is the default or initial branch which git checks out locally when we clone the repository.


    > h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the `main` branch?
    No.It's a good practice to create a new branch and push it to remote to create a pull request(review and collaborate) before merging to the main branch
